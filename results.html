This top floor two bed beauty stands with the best we've seen. Awash with tasteful touches, it commands an unbeatably bright 4th floor, treetop position. The decor is picture perfect throughout and there is a decent amount of fitted storage. Both your bedrooms are comfortable doubles and you have that sunny balcony on which to sip away the summer evenings. A three minute stroll has you in Denmark Hill Station awaiting one of its fast and frequent central London connections. The London Overground Line, too, will whisk you hither thither. Nearby Camberwell supplies any amount of social and culinary attractions and East Dulwich is just a touch further. ", "The grounds are lush and expertly maintained. It's a lovely spot to hobnob with the friendly neighbours. Inward bound you find spotless communal hallways and a lift which whisks you to the fourth floor. Your inner hall is long and well presented with neutral decor and fitted shelving for all your best sellers. Head far left to find the insatiably light and airy living room - you'll need your sunglasses in doors! The aspect is peaceful enough with the added benefit of secondary glazing. Your first balcony access point is to the front of the room - we're picturing Pimms gatherings a plenty come June. Next along the hall sits a modern kitchen with striking, fire engine red units and open shelving which glimpses back through to the reception. It's a really lovely feature. A well proportioned bathroom comes next on the tour with contemporary tiling and a modern suite. You'll find a handy recessed cupboard in the hall - perfect for dusters, Dysons and detritus. Your first dishy double bedroom is a decent size and enjoys much the same bright disposition. Further balcony access is offered through an original Crittal door. The larger, master bedroom complete the tour nicely with a rather pretty accent wall and more tasty wooden flooring. ", "The location boasts as much to shout about, enjoying the best of south Camberwell and East Dulwich. Denmark Hill station (Zone 2) has regular services to Victoria and Blackfriars and is within 3 minutes stroll - you can also catch the fab London Overground line here. Clapham High Street and Shoreditch are easy peasy! Ruskin Park is a 2 minute walk and Kings College and The Maudsley hospitals are walkable in under 10. You can get the weekly shop done in the Sainsbury's Superstore on Dog Kennel Hill, just a pleasant 5 minute stroll or a minute away in the car. If you don't want to cook, you have the lovely George Canning gourmet pub just four minutes on foot. The award winning 'Camberwell Arms' does a mean roast and the Crooked Well is much loved for its vino and cuisine. Head down to lovely Lordship Lane for more interesting shops and some fantastic foodie outlets - we're in love with 'Tart' - the new kid on the block!"]},
