When I bought 123 NP four years ago, it had been stripped of most of its Victorian features but I still fell in love with it as soon as I walked through the door. <br>As this was my first solo renovation project, I have renovated slowly, room by room, restoring original features, opening fireplaces, and exposing original Victorian features such as the ceiling rose and tiling in order to respect the homes heritage. <br>There are many things I love about this home: easy walking distance to two main line train stations; lighting fires in autumn and winter; the lovely high ceilings and bay window; despite being on a main road it is quiet and serene once inside the flat; the back garden is magic all year round as it is secluded and larger than most gardens in this area\".<br><br>These particulars, whilst believed to be accurate are set out as a general outline only for guidance and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract. Intending purchasers should not rely on them as statements of representation of fact, but must satisfy themselves by inspection or otherwise as to their accuracy.
